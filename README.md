Hi everyone, This is the Github repository for the various Data Structures I have started to implement.Following are the Data Structure I am going to implement here:
- [ ] 1. Linked List
     - [x] 1. Insertion
     - [ ] 2. Deletion
     - [ ] 3. Doubly Linked List
- [ ] 2. Stack
- [ ] 3. Queue
- [ ] 4. Trees
- [ ] 5. Graphs

I'll update the above list as well as my code database regularly.In this way I started to learn Github. i know I'll commit many mistakes and you all are there to correct me. I'll give my 100% effort to make this Little Project of mine possible.

### EDIT :
       I have updated the project on **12/07/2017**. Now I am creating Header Files for clean coding. 
       Regularly I'll update this **repository** as I'll learn stuff. Its fun using **Github**. 
       I'll come up with new project ideas in the coming days and soon I'll start a new project.
